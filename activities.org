** 4th World Scout Inter-religious Symposium – Iksan, S. Korea 1st to 5th August, 2012
   by Inka Hopsu

The 4th World Scout Inter-religious Symposium (WSIS) was held from 1st
to 5th August 2012 at WonKwang University, Iksan South Korea. This
event was hosted jointly by The Korea Scouts Association and Won-Buddhism Scouts Council (WBSC). It was organized by members of the World Scout Inter-religious Forum (WSIF), an informal network of
religious groups/organizations in Scouting, and was supported by the
World Scout Bureau.

The theme of this symposium was "Growing Scouting through Families and Communities". Discussion was focused mostly on growth and not that much on spiritual dimension. All the present Religious groups: ICCS,
IUMS, Buddhist, Von-Buddhist, CPGS represent their latest news.

** Roverway 2012
   In 2012, a Roverway took place in Finland. At this jamboree, where 3500 rovers out of more than 50 countries (mostly Europeans but not only) and from several religious confessions came by, the presence of the CPGS had a real meaning.

   In the “Live your life” path, between the Catholics, Jewish and other non confessional spiritual meditation tents, the CPGS offered a internal meditation activity based on several moments of the Christian life, materialize by pearls of different form and color: the “Pearls of life”. 

   Created by a Swedish Lutheran bishop in 1966, this 18 pearls bracelet gives each participant the opportunity to ask himself questions of life, to pry, to meditate, without any concrete prayer formulation. Each pearl is accompanied with a small text detailing her meaning and her integration in our life, and also with some questions about yourself bringing the participant to prayer or meditation as wanted by bishop Lönnebo.

   The bracelet begins with the golden pearl and goes counter-clockwise (as they represent the path of life):
   - The pearl of God 
   - The pearl of Silence 
   - The I-pearl 
   - The pearl of Baptism 
   - The pearl of Silence 
   - The Desert pearl 
   - The pearl of Silence 
   - The Serenity pearl 
   - The pearl of Silence
   - Two pearls of Love 
   - Three pearls of Mystery (pearls of Secret)
   - The Night pearl (pearl of Darkness) 
   - The pearl of Silence 
   - The pearl of Resurrection 
   - The pearl of Silence 

   At the end of the four days of Roverway, the results are very positives. Lot of people came to the CPGS tent; some of them stayed a while at the meditation place in order to “answer” the questions asked by the pearls and several leaved traces of their meditation through messages written on papers stamped to the tent. Following her own success, the CPGS tent went out of pearls before the end of the Roverway and the last person to come by could only get the explanations of the pearls and the associated meditation.

   The CPGS tent was animated by 2 people of the CPGS board (from Finland and France) and 2 persons out of the German VCP, also member of the CPGS.
