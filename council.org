* The Committee
** Annette von Stockhausen – Chairman 
   I am member of the CPGS board since 2011. In the German Verband
   Christlicher Pfadfinderinnen und Pfadfinder (VCP) I have been
   active for more than 25 years from local to national level, e.g.
   as head of the committee for our partnership with the Israeli
   scouts, as head of our contingent to the Jamboree in Sweden and as
   member of our national board. 

   I am a theologian by profession and teach church history at university.
** Adrien Chaboche – Vice-Chairman
** Magali Prévot – Treasurer
